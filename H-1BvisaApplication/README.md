Overview:

This project represents my first attempt at a real-world data analysis using R. The focus is on analyzing H-1B visa application trends from 2020 to 2024 using data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) H-1B Employer Data Hub.
Project Highlights:

    Analysis of H-1B visa approval and denial rates over a 5-year period
    Visualization of trends using ggplot2
    Statistical analysis including chi-square test for significance
    Exploration of geographical and industry-wise distribution of H-1B applications

Key Findings:

    Increasing approval rates and decreasing denial rates over the study period
    Significant changes in H-1B processing trends (p-value < 2.2e-16)
    Top 5 states and industries for H-1B applications identified

Data Source:

The data used in this analysis is from the H-1B Employer Data Hub provided by USCIS.
Tools Used

    More advanced statistical analyses
    Interactive visualizations
    Deeper dive into industry-specific trends
    Time series analysis for better forecasting
