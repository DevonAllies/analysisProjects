abstract = {Identification of protein quantitative trait loci ({pQTL}) helps understand the underlying mechanisms of diseases and discover promising targets for pharmacological intervention. For most important class of drug targets, genetic evidence needs to be generalizable to diverse populations. Given that the majority of the previous studies were conducted in European ancestry populations, little is known about the protein-associated genetic variants in East Asians. Based on data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry technique, we conduct genome-wide association analyses for 304 unique proteins in 2,958 Han Chinese participants. We identify 195 genetic variant-protein associations. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses highlight 60 gene-protein-phenotype associations, 45 of which (75\%) have not been prioritized in Europeans previously. Further cross-ancestry analyses uncover key proteins that contributed to the differences in the obesity-induced diabetes and coronary artery disease susceptibility. These findings provide novel druggable proteins as well as a unique resource for the trans-ancestry evaluation of protein-targeted drug discovery. \copyright 2023. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Tuberculosis ({TB}) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within {TB} granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. In vitro {TB} models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic {3D} spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically {CD8}+ T cells. This higher level of {CD8}+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a {CD4}+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/{CD8}+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of in vitro models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant in vitro models and advancing our understanding of {TB} pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

abstract = {Tuberculosis ({TB}) is an ancient human disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which mainly affects the lungs, making pulmonary disease the most common presentation (K Zaman, 2010) . However, {TB} is a multi-systemic disease with a protean presentation. The organ system most commonly affected includes the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal ({GI}) system, the lymphoreticular system, the skin, the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, the reproductive system, and the liver . Evidence of {TB} has been reported in human remains dated thousands of years (Hershkovitz et al., 2017, K Zaman 2010). For a human pathogen with no known environmental reservoir, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has honed the art of survival and has persisted in human communities from antiquity through modern time. In the past few decades, there has been a concerted global effort to eradicate {TB}. These efforts had yielded some positive dividends especially since 2000 when the World  Health Organization ({WHO},  2017) estimated that the global incidence rate for tuberculosis has fallen by 1.5\% every year. Furthermore, mortality arising from tuberculosis has significantly and steadily declined. The World Health Organization ({WHO}, 2016) reports a 22\% drop in global {TB} mortality from 2000 through 2015. Despite the gains in tuberculosis control and the decline in both new cases and mortality, {TB} still accounts for a huge burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The bulk of the global burden of new infection and tuberculosis death is borne by developing countries with 6 countries, India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa, accounting for 60\% of {TB} death in 2015, ({WHO}, 2017) . Tuberculosis remains a significant cause of both illness and death in developed countries especially among individuals with a suppressed immune system. People with {HIV} are particularly vulnerable to death due to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis accounted for 35\% of global mortality in individuals with {HIV}/{AIDS} in 2015. (W.H.O, 2017). Children are also vulnerable, and tuberculosis was responsible for one million illnesses in children in 2015 according to the {WHO}. Copyright \copyright 2022, {StatPearls} Publishing {LLC}.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} (Xpert {MTB}/{RIF}) and Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} Ultra (Xpert Ultra), the newest version, are the only World Health Organization ({WHO})-recommended rapid tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in persons with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. A previous Cochrane Review found Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} sensitive and specific for tuberculosis (Steingart 2014). Since the previous review, new studies have been published. We performed a review update for an upcoming {WHO} policy review. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine diagnostic accuracy of Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} and Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis ({PTB}) and for rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, {MEDLINE}, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the {WHO} International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and {ProQuest}, to 11 October 2018, without language restriction. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies using respiratory specimens that evaluated Xpert {MTB}/{RIF}, Xpert Ultra, or both against the reference standard, culture for tuberculosis and culture-based drug susceptibility testing or {MTBDRplus} for rifampicin resistance. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Four review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. When possible, we also extracted data by smear and {HIV} status. We assessed study quality using {QUADAS}-2 and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity separately for tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. Most analyses used a bivariate random-effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated accuracy using all included studies and then only the subset of studies where participants were unselected, i.e. not selected based on prior microscopy testing. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We identified in total 95 studies (77 new studies since the previous review): 86 studies (42,091 participants) evaluated Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} for tuberculosis and 57 studies (8287 participants) for rifampicin resistance. One study compared Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} and Xpert Ultra on the same participant specimen.Tuberculosis {detectionOf} the total 86 studies, 45 took place in high tuberculosis burden and 50 in high {TB}/{HIV} burden countries. Most studies had low risk of bias.Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} pooled sensitivity and specificity (95\% credible Interval ({CrI})) were 85\% (82\% to 88\%) and 98\% (97\% to 98\%), (70 studies, 37,237 unselected participants; high-certainty evidence). We found similar accuracy when we included all studies.For a population of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculosis on culture, 103 would be Xpert {MTB}/{RIF}-positive and 18 (17\%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); 897 would be Xpert {MTB}/{RIF}-negative and 15 (2\%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95\% confidence interval ({CI})) was 88\% (85\% to 91\%) versus Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} 83\% (79\% to 86\%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 96\% (94\% to 97\%) versus Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} 98\% (97\% to 99\%), (1 study, 1439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} pooled sensitivity was 98\% (97\% to 98\%) in smear-positive and 67\% (62\% to 72\%) in smear-negative, culture-positive participants, (45 studies). Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} pooled sensitivity was 88\% (83\% to 92\%) in {HIV}-negative and 81\% (75\% to 86\%) in {HIV}-positive participants; specificities were similar 98\% (97\% to 99\%), (14 studies).Rifampicin resistance {detectionXpert} {MTB}/{RIF} pooled sensitivity and specificity (95\% Crl) were 96\% (94\% to 97\%) and 98\% (98\% to 99\%), (48 studies, 8020 participants; high-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 114 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and 18 (16\%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); 886 would be would be negative for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and four (0.4\%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives).Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95\% {CI}) was 95\% (90\% to 98\%) versus Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} 95\% (91\% to 98\%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 98\% (97\% to 99\%) versus Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} 98\% (96\% to 99\%), (1 study, 551 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: We found Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} to be sensitive and specific for diagnosing {PTB} and rifampicin resistance, consistent with findings reported previously. Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} was more sensitive for tuberculosis in smear-positive than smear-negative participants and {HIV}-negative than {HIV}-positive participants. Compared with Xpert {MTB}/{RIF}, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity for tuberculosis and similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance (1 study). Xpert {MTB}/{RIF} and Xpert Ultra provide accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.}

Although the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose {LTBI}, these methods can only differentiate infected individuals from healthy ones but cannot discriminate between {LTBI} and {ATB}. Thus, the diagnosis of {LTBI} faces many challenges, such as the lack of effective biomarkers from Mycobacterium tuberculosis ({MTB}) for distinguishing {LTBI}, the low diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers derived from the human host, and the absence of a gold standard to differentiate between {LTBI} and {ATB}. Sputum culture, as the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis, is time-consuming and cannot distinguish between {ATB} and {LTBI}. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of {MTB} and the immune mechanisms of the host in {LTBI}, including the innate and adaptive immune responses, multiple immune evasion mechanisms of {MTB}, and epigenetic regulation. Based on this knowledge, we summarize the current status and challenges in diagnosing {LTBI} and present the application of machine learning ({ML}) in {LTBI} diagnosis, as well as the advantages and limitations of {ML} in this context. Finally, we discuss the future development directions of {ML} applied to {LTBI} diagnosis. \copyright 2023. The Author(s).}

Thus, the study aims to delineate the role of diabetes in activation of latent tuberculosis infection. Murine model of latent tuberculosis and diabetes was developed, bacillary load and gene expression of resuscitation promoting factors ({rpfA}-E) along with histopathological changes in the lungs and spleen were studied. Treatment for {LTBI} [Rifampicin ({RIF}) + Isoniazid ({INH})] was also given to latently infected mice with or without diabetes for 4 weeks. Diabetes was found to activate latent tuberculosis as the colony forming unit ({CFU}) counts were observed to be \textgreater 104 in lungs and spleen. The gene expression of {hspX} was downregulated and that of {rpfB} and {rpfD} was observed to be upregulated in latently infected mice with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. However, no significant reduction in the {CFU} counts was observed after 4 weeks of treatment with {RIF} and {INH}. Diabetes helps in the progression of {LTBI} to active disease mainly through altered expression of resuscitation promoting factors {rpfB} and {rpfD}, which can serve as important targets to reduce the shared burden of tuberculosis and diabetes. \copyright 2021.

Although mouse infection studies show that they support bacterial survival and disease reactivation, it is currently unknown whether Rpfs influence human infection. We hypothesized that tuberculous sputum might include a population of Rpf-dependent Mtb cells. {OBJECTIVES}: To determine whether Rpf-dependent Mtb cells are present in human sputum and explore the impact of chemotherapy on this population. {METHODS}: In tuberculous sputum samples we compared the number of cells detected by conventional agar colony-forming assay with that determined by limiting dilution, most-probable number assay in the presence or absence of Rpf preparations. {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: In 20 of 25 prechemotherapy samples from separate patients, 80-99.99\% of the cells demonstrated by cultivation could be detected only with Rpf stimulation. Mtb cells with this phenotype were not generated on specimen storage or by inoculating sputum samples with a selection of clinical isolates; moreover, Rpf dependency was lost after primary isolation. During chemotherapy, the proportion of Rpf-dependent cells was found to increase relative to the surviving colony-forming population. {CONCLUSIONS}: Smear-positive sputum samples are dominated by a population of Mtb cells that can be grown only in the presence of Rpfs. These intriguing proteins are therefore relevant to human infection. The Rpf-dependent population is invisible to conventional culture and is progressively enhanced in relative terms during chemotherapy, indicating a form of phenotypic resistance that may be significant for both chemotherapy and transmission.}

Resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) are proteins that act as signalling molecules mediating growth and replication. In this study we aimed to test the effect of Rpfs from Micrococcus luteus on the number and diversity of cultured bacteria using insect and soil samples, and to examine if the increase in culturability could be reproduced with the putative reaction product of Rpf, 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (1,6-anhydro-{MurNAc}). The rpf gene from Micrococcus luteus was amplified and cloned into a {pET21b} expression vector and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli {BL21}({DE3}) cells and purified by affinity chromatography using a hexa-histidine tag. 1,6-Anhydro-{MurNAc} was prepared using reported chemical synthesis methods. Recombinant Rpf protein or 1,6-anhydro-{MurNAc} were added to {R2A} cultivation media, and their effect on the culturability of bacteria from eight environmental samples including four cockroach guts and four soils was examined. Colony-forming units, {16S} {rRNA} gene copies and Illumina amplicon sequencing of the {16S} {rRNA} gene were measured for all eight samples subjected to three different treatments: Rpf, 1,6-anhydro-{MurNAc} or blank control. Both Rpf and 1,6-anhydro-{MurNAc} increased the number of colony-forming units and of {16S} {rRNA} gene copies across the samples although the protein was more effective. The Rpf and 1,6-anhydro-{MurNAc} promoted the cultivation of a diverse set of bacteria and in particular certain clades of the phyla Actinomycetota and Bacillota . This study opens the path for improved cultivation strategies aiming to isolate and study yet undescribed living bacterial organisms. \copyright 2023 The Authors.}

abstract = {Some genetic variations in cytokine genes can alter their expression and influence the evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. This study aimed to investigate the association of polymorphisms in cytokine genes and variability in plasma levels of cytokines with the development of tuberculosis ({TB}) and latent tuberculosis infection ({LTBI}). Blood samples from 245 patients with {TB}, 80 with {LTBI}, and healthy controls (n = 100) were included. Genotyping of the {IFNG} +{874A}/T, {IL6} -{174G}/C, {IL4} -{590C}/T, and {IL10} -{1082A}/G polymorphisms was performed by real-time {PCR}, and cytokine levels were determined by flow cytometry. Higher frequencies of genotypes {AA} ({IFNG} +{874A}/T), {GG} ({IL6} -{174G}/C), {TT} ({IL4} -{590C}/T), and {GG} ({IL10} -{1082A}/G) were associated with an increased risk of {TB} compared to that of {LTBI} (p = 0.0027; p = 0.0557; p = 0.0286; p = 0.0361, respectively) and the control (p = \textless 0.0001, p = 0.0021; p = 0.01655; p = 0.0132, respectively). In combination, the A allele for {IFNG} +{874A}/T and the T allele for {IL4} -{590C}/T were associated with a higher chance of {TB} (p = 0.0080; {OR} = 2.753 and p \textless 0.0001; {OR} = 3.273, respectively). The {TB} group had lower levels of {IFN}-\gamma and higher concentrations of {IL}-6, {IL}-4, and {IL}-10. Cytokine levels were different between the genotypes based on the polymorphisms investigated (p \textless 0.05). The genotype and wild-type allele for {IFNG} +{874A}/T and the genotype and polymorphic allele for {IL4} -{590C}/T appear to be more relevant in the context of Mtb infection, which has been associated with the development of {TB} among individuals infected by the bacillus and with susceptibility to active infection but not with susceptibility to latent infection.}

These assays however, do not discriminate between latent {TB} infection ({LTBI}) and active {TB} disease.{METHODS}: We recruited twenty-three pulmonary {TB} patients and 34 household contacts from Cape Town, South Africa and performed the {QFT} test. To investigate the ability of new host markers to differentiate between {LTBI} and active {TB}, levels of 29 biomarkers in {QFT} supernatants were evaluated using a Luminex multiplex cytokine assay.{RESULTS}: Eight out of 29 biomarkers distinguished active {TB} from {LTBI} in a pilot study. Baseline levels of epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) soluble {CD40} ligand ({sCD40L}), antigen stimulated levels of {EGF}, and the background corrected antigen stimulated levels of {EGF} and macrophage inflammatory protein ({MIP})-1beta were the most informative single markers for differentiation between {TB} disease and {LTBI}, with {AUCs} of 0.88, 0.84, 0.87, 0.90 and 0.79 respectively. The combination of {EGF} and {MIP}-1beta predicted 96\% of active {TB} cases and 92\% of {LTBIs}. Combinations between {EGF}, {sCD40L}, {VEGF}, {TGF}-alpha and {IL}-1alpha also showed potential to differentiate between {TB} infection states. {EGF}, {VEGF}, {TGF}-alpha and {sCD40L} levels were higher in {TB} patients.{CONCLUSION}: These preliminary data suggest that active {TB} may be accurately differentiated from {LTBI} utilizing adaptations of the commercial {QFT} test that includes measurement of {EGF}, {sCD40L}, {MIP}-1beta, {VEGF}, {TGF}-alpha or {IL}-1alpha in supernatants from {QFT} assays. This approach holds promise for development as a rapid diagnostic test for active {TB}.}

abstract = {Phagocytosis of tubercle bacilli by antigen-presenting cells in human lung alveoli initiates a complex infection process by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a potentially protective immune response by the host. M. tuberculosis has devoted a large part of its genome towards functions that allow it to successfully establish latent or progressive infection in the majority of infected individuals. The failure of immune-mediated clearance is due to multiple strategies adopted by M. tuberculosis that blunt the microbicidal mechanisms of infected immune cells and formation of distinct granulomatous lesions that differ in their ability to support or suppress the persistence of viable M. tuberculosis. In this paper, current understanding of various immune processes that lead to the establishment of latent M. tuberculosis infection, bacterial spreading, persistence, reactivation, and waning or elimination of latent infection as well as new diagnostic approaches being used for identification of latently infected individuals for possible control of tuberculosis epidemic are described.}

abstract = {The major innate immune cell types involved in tuberculosis ({TB}) infection are macrophages, dendritic cells ({DCs}), neutrophils and natural killer ({NK}) cells. These immune cells recognize the {TB}-causing pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) through various pattern recognition receptors ({PRRs}), including but not limited to Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}), Nod-like receptors ({NLRs}) and C-type lectin receptors ({CLRs}). Upon infection by Mtb, the host orchestrates multiple signaling cascades via the {PRRs} to launch a variety of innate immune defense functions such as phagocytosis, autophagy, apoptosis and inflammasome activation. In contrast, Mtb utilizes numerous exquisite strategies to evade or circumvent host innate immunity. Here we discuss recent research on major host innate immune cells, {PRR} signaling, and the cellular functions involved in Mtb infection, with a specific focus on the host's innate immune defense and Mtb immune evasion. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions could provide a rational basis for the development of effective anti-{TB} therapeutics.}

abstract = {Tuberculosis ({TB}) remains a serious threat to public health, causing 2 million deaths annually world-wide. The control of {TB} has been hindered by the requirement of long duration of treatment involving multiple chemotherapeutic agents, the increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the {HIV}-infected population, and the development of multi-drug resistant and extensively resistant strains of tubercle bacilli. An efficacious and cost-efficient way to control {TB} is the development of effective anti-{TB} vaccines. This measure requires thorough understanding of the immune response to M. tuberculosis. While the role of cell-mediated immunity in the development of protective immune response to the tubercle bacillus has been well established, the role of B cells in this process is not clearly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that B cells and humoral immunity can modulate the immune response to various intracellular pathogens, including M. tuberculosis. These lymphocytes form conspicuous aggregates in the lungs of tuberculous humans, non-human primates, and mice, which display features of germinal center B cells. In murine {TB}, it has been shown that B cells can regulate the level of granulomatous reaction, cytokine production, and the T cell response. This chapter discusses the potential mechanisms by which specific functions of B cells and humoral immunity can shape the immune response to intracellular pathogens in general, and to M. tuberculosis in particular. Knowledge of the B cell-mediated immune response to M. tuberculosis may lead to the design of novel strategies, including the development of effective vaccines, to better control {TB}.}

abstract = {Historically, research on the immunologic response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection has focused on T cells and macrophages, as their role in granuloma formation has been robustly characterized. In contrast, the role of B cells in the pathophysiology of M. tb infection has been relatively overlooked. While T cells are well-known as an essential for granuloma formation and maintenance, B cells play a less understood role in the host response. Over the past decade, scarce research on the topic has attempted to elucidate the varying roles of B cells during mycobacterial infection, which appears to be primarily time dependent. From acute to chronic infection, the role of B cells changes with time as evidenced by cytokine release, immunological regulation, and histological morphology of tuberculous granulomas. The goal of this review is to carefully analyze the role of humoral immunity in M. tb infection to find the discriminatory nature of humoral immunity in tuberculosis ({TB}). We argue that there is a need for more research on the B-cell response against {TB}, as a better understanding of the role of B cells in defense against {TB} could lead to effective vaccines and therapies. By focusing on the B-cell response, we can develop new strategies to enhance immunity against {TB} and reduce the burden of disease.}

We compared M. tuberculosis-specific T cell-associated cytokine production and proliferative capacity in peripheral blood from adults with progressively higher mycobacterial loads-that is, persons with latent M. tuberculosis infection ({LTBI}), with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis ({TB}), and smear-positive {TB}. Patients with smear-positive {TB} had decreased polyfunctional {IFN}-\gamma(+){IL}-2(+){TNF}-\alpha(+) and {IL}-2-producing specific {CD4} T cells and increased {TNF}-\alpha single-positive cells, when compared with smear-negative {TB} and {LTBI}. {TB} patients also had increased frequencies of M. tuberculosis-specific {CD8} T cells, compared with {LTBI}. M. tuberculosis-specific {CD4} and {CD8} T cell proliferative capacity was profoundly impaired in individuals with smear-positive {TB}, and correlated positively with ex vivo {IFN}-\gamma(+){IL}-2(+){TNF}-\alpha(+) {CD4} T cells, and inversely with {TNF}-\alpha single-positive {CD4} T cells. During 6 mo of anti-{TB} treatment, specific {IFN}-\gamma(+){IL}-2(+){TNF}-\alpha(+) {CD4} and {CD8} T cells increased, whereas {TNF}-\alpha and {IFN}-\gamma single-positive T cells decreased. These results suggest progressive impairment of M. tuberculosis-specific T cell responses with increasing mycobacterial load and recovery of responses during therapy. Furthermore, these data provide a link between specific cytokine-producing subsets and functional capacity of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, and between the presence of specific {CD8} T cells ex vivo and active {TB} disease. These data have potentially significant applications for the diagnosis of {TB} and for the identification of T cell correlates of {TB} disease progression.}

The gut microbiota and metabolites have been found to be useful in elucidating potential biological mechanisms of pulmonary diseases. Therefore, our study aims to investigate the effects of gut microbiota and metabolites mediating {SGLT2} inhibition in 10 pulmonary diseases through Mendelian randomization ({MR}) research. {METHODS}: We conducted a two-sample, two-step {MR} study to assess the association between {SGLT2} inhibition and 10 pulmonary diseases and to investigate the mediating effects of gut microbiota and metabolite. Gene-fine mapping and annotation of mediators by {FUMA} and Magma analyses were performed, and causal associations of mapped genes with diseases were assessed by muti-omics {MR} analyses. Possible side effects of {SGLT2} inhibition were assessed by {PheWAS} analysis. {RESULTS}: {SGLT2} inhibition was linked to a reduced risk of {T2DM}, Interstitial lung disease ({ILD}), Pneumoconiosis, Pulmonary tuberculosis, and Asthma({OR}=0.457, 0.054, 0.002, 0.280, 0.706). The family Enterobacteriaceae and order Enterobacteriales were associated with {SGLT2} inhibition and {ILD}(95\% {CI}:0.079-0.138). The family Alcaligenaceae and X-12719 were linked to pneumoconiosis (95\% {CI}: 0.042-0.120, 0.050-0.099). The genus Phascolarctobacterium was connected to pulmonary tuberculosis (95\% {CI}: 0.236-0.703).The degree of unsaturation (Fatty Acids), ratio of docosahexaenoic acid to total fatty acids, and 4-androsten-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate 2, were associated with asthma(95\% {CI}: 0.042-0.119, 0.039-0.101, 0.181-0.473). Furthermore, Fuma and Magma analyses identified target genes for the four diseases, and proteomic {MR} analysis revealed six overlapping target genes in asthma. {PheWAS} analysis also highlighted potential side effects of {SGLT2} inhibition. {CONCLUSIONS}: This comprehensive study strongly supports a multi-omics association between {SGLT2} inhibition and reduced risk of interstitial lung disease, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and asthma. Four identified gut microbiota, four metabolites, sixteen metabolic pathways, and six target genes appear to play a potential role in this association. The results of the comprehensive phenome-wide association analysis also identified the full effect of {SGLT2} inhibitors. Copyright \copyright 2024 Yuan, Zhang, Jia, Zhao, Wan and Liu.}
